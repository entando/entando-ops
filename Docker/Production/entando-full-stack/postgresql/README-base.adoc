# Entando Full Stack PostgreSQL Image

This image contains a sample of the Entando PORT and SERV databases in PostgreSQL format. These databases can be used to back 
the Entando Full Stack Engine API image. They have been pre-populated with the default data required by all the the standard Entando plugins. 
On startup, these sample databases are copied to the /var/lib/pgsql/data directory where PostgreSQL stores its data, where it is typically
mapped to a persistent volume on the Docker host. Deleting this volume would reset the database to the original state.


## Environment Variables

This image has been pre-built with specific values for the standard environment variables that the Entando PostgreSQL Base Image supports.
Please do not change any of the values as it could potentially interfere with the behaviour of the image. THe following environment
variable values have been set and can be used to connect to the PORT and SERV databases respectively.
 
**PORTDB_DATABASE**=portdb, {PORTDB_DATABASE}

**PORTDB_USERNAME**=portdb, {PORTDB_USERNAME}

**PORTDB_PASSWORD**=portdb, {PORTDB_PASSWORD}

**SERVDB_DATABASE**=servdb, {SERVDB_DATABASE}

**SERVDB_USERNAME**=servdb, {SERVDB_USERNAME}

**SERVDB_PASSWORD**=servdb, {SERVDB_PASSWORD}

**ADMIN_PASSWORD**=adminpwd, {ADMIN_PASSWORD}

## Ports

**5432**: this image exposes the PostgreSQL database server at the standard port of 5432

## Volumes

**/var/lib/pgsql/data**: this image inherits the standard PostgreSQL volume from a parent image. This is where the 
sample databases are copied to and where subsequence modifications to them will be persisted.

## How to run

```
docker volume create entando-pg-data 
docker run -it --rm -d -p 5432:5432 -v entando-pg-data://var/lib/pgsql/data entando/postgresql:5.2.0
```
