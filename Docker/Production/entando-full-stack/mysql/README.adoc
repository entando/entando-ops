//Template parameters
:APPLICATION_NAME:  an Openshift compliant name that can be used as a prefix to automatically  generate names for related objects in the Template
:IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE: the name of the Openshift project that contains all the  ImageStreams required for the Template  in question. If the ImageStreams were created in the default 'openshift' project,  Openshift will automatically add it to  its application catalog. It is however possible to store them in any   project, including the project that the current Template is being instantiated in.
:ENTANDO_IMAGE_VERSION: the version number of the Entando images that will be used. In Docker, this will be the 'tag' segment of the Image repository reference. In Openshift, this will be the name of a Tag in the ImageStreams that will be used to bind all  S2I BuildConfigs and  DeploymentConfigs to. This generally corresponds with the version of Entando being used.
:ENTANDO_ENGINE_HOSTNAME: the fully qualified domain name of the Route that will be  created to expose the Entando Runtime Service using HTTP without SSL. This variable  is often used to connect to from the App Builder. You therefore need to make sure that it is accessible from outside the Openshift cluster.
:ENTANDO_ENGINE_SECURE_HOSTNAME: the fully qualified domain name of the Route that will be  created to expose the Entando Runtime Service using SSL/HTTPS. This variable  is often used to connect to from the App Builder. You therefore need to make sure that it is accessible from outside the Openshift cluster.
:ENTANDO_APP_BUILDER_HOSTNAME: the fully qualified domain name of the Route that will be  created to expose the Entando App Builder JavaScript App  using HTTP without SSL.
:ENTANDO_APP_BUILDER_SECURE_HOSTNAME: the fully qualified domain name of the Route that will be  created to expose the Entando App Builder JavaScript App using SSL/HTTPS.
:ENTANDO_ENGINE_BASEURL: The full URL that AppBuilder must use to connect to the Entando Runtime. This parameter is required in situations where AppBuilder can connet to the Entando Runtime using either HTTP or HTTPS. AppBuilder does not work well with self-signed certificates so for test environments you may sometimes fall back on the HTTP Route. Also keep in mind that you may need to append the web context that the Entando app is served at by the JEE servlet container.
:ENTANDO_ENGINE_WEB_CONTEXT: the context root  of the Entando Web Application. This is the context  on the JEE server that will be used to dispatch requests to the Entando Web Application. Generally this would be the same as the APPLICATION_NAME. In typical JEE deployments this would be the name of the war file, excluding the '.war' extension. In typical Maven projects, this would be the value of the <finalName> element in the pom.xml
:SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL: the full URL of the source repository where the source code of the image that needs to be built can be found
:SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF: the branch or tag that will be checked out from the source repository specified at the SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL
:SOURCE_SECRET: the Openshift Secret containing the Username and Password for the source repository specified at the SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL
:CONTEXT_DIR: the relative directory inside the source repository from which the build should be  executed.
:VOLUME_CAPACITY: the amount of storage space to be allocated to the Entando App. This needs to be large enough for documents and images that are uploaded, database backups that need to be made,  and the indices that Entando generates. Depending  on the exact template, this may aslo include the space required for the embedded Derby database.
:MEMORY_LIMIT: the maximum amount of memory to be allocated to the Entando JEE App.
:DOMAIN_SUFFIX:  the domain suffix will be appended to the various service names to form a full domain name for the Route of the  mapped to the service. This parameter is required to ensure that the AppBuider points to the externally accessible URL that serves Entando App.
:GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET: Github webhook secret that can be used from Github to trigger builds on this BuildConfig in the Openshift cluster
:GENERIC_WEBHOOK_SECRET: Generic webhook secret that can be used from any generic SCM tool to trigger builds on this BuildConfig in the Openshift cluster
:MAVEN_MIRROR_URL: Maven mirror to use for S2I builds. Specifying a Maven mirror such as Nexus, running in the same cluster can significantly speed up build execution.
:MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND: additional Maven arguments that will be appended to the standard Maven command used in the S2I build
:ARTIFACT_DIR: List of directories from which archives will be copied into the deployment folder. If unspecified, all archives in /target will be copied.


:FSI_CCD_DEMO_DESCRIPTION: The Entando team, Red Hat and our business partners have collaborated to bring you a demo that illustrates how Entando can be used as the user experience layer for your Red Hat Process Automation Manager processes. The process in question allows customers to initiate a dispute case against a specific transaction. This demo provides two Entando apps - a customer facing app and a back-office app. These apps connect to a shared KIE Server instance.
:EAP_IMAGE_DISCLAIMER: Please note that this configuration uses a child image of the official JBoss EAP commercial Docker Image. This would mean that  in order to deploy this in a production environment, you would need to purchase the necessary subscription from Red Hat first.

# Entando Full Stack MySQL Image

This image contains a sample of the Entando PORT and SERV databases in MySQL format. These databases can be used to back
the Entando Full Stack Engine API image. They have been pre-populated with the default data required by all the the standard Entando plugins. 
On startup, these sample databases are copied to the /var/lib/mysql/data directory where MySQL stores its data, where it is typically
mapped to a persistent volume on the Docker host. Deleting this volume would reset the database to the original state.


## Environment Variables

This image has been pre-built with specific values for the standard environment variables that the Entando MySQL Base Image supports.
Please do not change any of the values as it could potentially interfere with the behaviour of the image. THe following environment
variable values have been set and can be used to connect to the PORT and SERV databases respectively.
 
**PORTDB_DATABASE**=portdb, {PORTDB_DATABASE}

**PORTDB_USERNAME**=portdb, {PORTDB_USERNAME}

**PORTDB_PASSWORD**=portdb, {PORTDB_PASSWORD}

**SERVDB_DATABASE**=servdb, {SERVDB_DATABASE}

**SERVDB_USERNAME**=servdb, {SERVDB_USERNAME}

**SERVDB_PASSWORD**=servdb, {SERVDB_PASSWORD}

**ADMIN_PASSWORD**=adminpwd, {ADMIN_PASSWORD}

## Ports

**3306**: this image exposes the MySQL database server at the standard port of 3306

## Volumes

**/var/lib/mysql/data**: this image inherits the standard MySQL volume from a parent image. This is where the
sample databases are copied to and where subsequence modifications to them will be persisted.

## How to run

```
docker volume create entando-mysql-data
docker run -it --rm -d -p 3306:3306 -v entando-mysql-data://var/lib/mysql/data entando/mysql:5.2.0
```
