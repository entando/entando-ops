# Entando FSI Credit Card Dispute Customer App 

This image contains the Entando Credit Card Dispute Customer App. It is intended for demonstration purposes only and should not be
used in a production environment. It uses a pre-built, embedded Derby database that is not cluster safe. It contains Red Hat's JBoss EAP 7.1
product and would therefore require the necessary licensing if used in a production environment. It also extends Red Hat's official 
JBoss EAP 7.1 image, which means it inherits all the functionality as documented in 
[Red Hat's image catalog](https://access.redhat.com/containers/?tab=overview#/registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-eap-7/eap71-openshift) 

## Environment Variables

Most of the environment variables of this image are pre-configured to point to the correct database. Please do not modify
any of the database related variables. The only variables that can be changed are those related to the 
Red Hat Process Automation Manager environment in use
